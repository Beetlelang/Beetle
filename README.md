# The Beetle Programming Language
Beetle is a programming language I made because I wanted to create a fast programming language for fun. Beetle scripts have the file extension .Beetle. The language is influenced within Rust, C, C++, Zig, and finally Python. Beetle was made in python

Before using Beetle, Know that there is n docuenatn bugs may appear, not enough syntax support. Adding more stuff will be supported on the next versin and optimizations may be added.

# Our Performance
We have a great performance. It ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 seconds to print ranging 1 to 99999.

# Installation
We are going to list a tutorial for each operating system, Note that some operating systems are not supported yet.

# Windows
1. Download the `beetle.zip` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended).
3. When opening the compiler remember to set it to the Python interpreter, You can download the python interpreter on their website.

(This is the current way since Beetle is currently made in mobile)

# Android

1. Download an python interpreter (Reccomended Pydroid 3)
2. Download beetle.zip
3. Extract the zip file
4. Open the python file from your python interpreter
5. Run the file

# Beetle Code Examples

printing a float number:
``` Beetle
println(1/2)
```

Note that beetle has some python syntax, So it's pretty easy to learn Beetle.

``` Beetle
e = input()

 fn say(e):
println(e+1)
```
