it’s time to write your first Beetle code. It’s traditional when learning a language to write a program that prints: 
``` python

# Writing and Executing an Beetle File
Next, create a new file. It can be called anything you want. Beetle files always end with the ```.beetle``` extension. If you’re using more than one word in the name of your file, You should put an underscore as the seperator. Example, use ```hello_guys.beetle```. Do not name a file which is similar to ```helloguys.beetle```.


Now open the beetlelang reader, If you haven't downloaded that we have it on the downloads folder. Then type the path to your beetle file. If this prints hello world. You have done your very first beetle program.
